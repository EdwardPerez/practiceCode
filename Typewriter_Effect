# in order to use sleep function
from time import sleep

#in order to use sys object
import sys

#Gets input and prompts user
userInput = input("Enter the word for typewriter effect: "); 

#Runs once for each charcter in userInput string
for x in userInput:

 # prints the charcter 
 # places the next charcter in the next character space (end='')
 # NOTE: editting end= changes spacing
  
  print(x, end='')

  #prints each character to the console individually before loop ends

  sys.stdout.flush()

  #cause program to wait argument time in seconds
